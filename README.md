Embedded Night-Vision System for Pedestrian Detection
This repository contains the design and implementation of an embedded night-vision system for real-time pedestrian detection in low-light and nighttime conditions. The system integrates infrared or night-vision sensors with optimized image processing algorithms to accurately detect pedestrians on embedded hardware.

Key features include robust computer vision techniques for low-light pedestrian recognition, efficient processing suitable for resource-constrained devices, and compatibility with various sensor types and embedded platforms. The project aims to improve pedestrian safety in applications such as autonomous vehicles, smart surveillance, and safety alert systems.

Technologies used are embedded C/C++, OpenCV for image processing, infrared sensor interfacing, and lightweight machine learning models optimized for edge computing.

This repository provides all necessary source code, documentation, and hardware designs to build and extend the system for research or practical deployment.
